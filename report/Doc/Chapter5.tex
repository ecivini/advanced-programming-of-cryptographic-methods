\chapter{Known Limitations}

This chapter provides a comprehensive analysis of the known limitations of the implemented Certificate Authority system. Understanding these limitations is crucial for proper deployment, risk assessment, and future development planning. The limitations are categorized by their nature and impact on the system's functionality and security.

\section{Functional Limitations}

\subsection{Limited Identity Verification}

\textbf{Limitation:} The current implementation uses simplified identity verification mechanisms compared to commercial Certificate Authorities.

\textbf{Description:} The system only verifies email ownership and private key possession, lacking the comprehensive identity validation processes used by production CAs. Real-world CAs typically perform:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Document-based identity verification (government IDs, business registrations)
    \item Domain validation for web certificates
    \item Extended validation procedures for high-assurance certificates
    \item Physical presence verification for certain certificate types
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Impact:} This limitation reduces the trust level that can be placed in issued certificates and makes the system unsuitable for high-stakes applications requiring strong identity assurance.

\textbf{Mitigation:} For production use, additional verification layers would need to be implemented, including integration with official identity verification services and document validation systems.

\subsection{Simplified Certificate Profiles}

\textbf{Limitation:} The system implements basic X.509 certificate profiles without the full range of extensions and policies used in production environments.

\textbf{Description:} The current implementation lacks support for:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Certificate policy extensions
    \item Authority Information Access (AIA) extensions
    \item Subject Alternative Names (SAN) for multiple identities
    \item Key usage constraints and extended key usage
    \item Certificate transparency integration
    \item Custom extension fields for specific use cases
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Impact:} Generated certificates may not be fully compatible with all applications and use cases that require specific certificate extensions or policy compliance.

\textbf{Mitigation:} Future development should include configurable certificate profiles and support for standard X.509 extensions based on intended use cases.

\subsection{Limited Revocation Mechanisms}

\textbf{Limitation:} The system only implements Certificate Revocation Lists (CRL) without support for more modern revocation mechanisms.

\textbf{Description:} Missing revocation features include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) support
    \item OCSP stapling capabilities
