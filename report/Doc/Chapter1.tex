\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:introduction}
This project implements a Certificate Authority (CA) system that manages digital certificates for 
secure communications. A CA is a trusted entity that issues digital certificates to verify the identity 
of users and the possession of a private key.
The system provides a complete solution for certificate management, including issuing new certificates, 
checking their validity, renewing them before expiration, and revoking them when necessary. 
The implementation focuses on security by using an Hardware Security Module (HSMs) to protect
the CA's private key and implementing proper verification procedures.
The system provides user-friendly interfaces through both API endpoints for developers and a web 
interface for end users. 

\section{Key features}

The Certificate Authority supports the complete certificate lifecycle. 
For certificate issuance, the system processes certificate requests, verifies the requester's identity, 
and issues signed certificates. 
It provides certificate validation by checking if certificates are valid, not expired, and haven't been revoked.

The system allows users to renew their certificates before they expire and handles certificate revocation 
for compromised or no longer needed certificates, maintaining a Certificate Revocation List (CRL). 
Identity verification ensures that certificate requesters own the private key and control the email 
address associated with their request.

\section{System architecture}

The system consists of several integrated components. The backend server is a Go API that handles 
all certificate operations and communicates with the database and HSM. 
A Next.js frontend application provides an easy-to-use web interface for certificate management.

Data persistence is handled by MongoDB storage for certificate records, user commitments, and system data. 
Security operations are performed by an HSM that stores the CA's private key 
and performs cryptographic operations. 
An automated email service supports identity verification during certificate requests.
