## Project description
In secure communication systems, a Certificate Authority (CA) is responsible for issuing and managing certificates inside a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). These certificates authenticate the identities of entities and bind them to their public keys, and form the foundation for secure communications between multiple parties.

This project involves implementing a simplified CA capable of handling operations such as certificate issuance, validation, renewal and revocation. In addition, we are going to use a cloud HSM to securely store the private key of the CA and process the signing requests. 

The CA will also verify that the certificate holders effectively own the correct private key and email.
